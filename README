======================
Development
=====================
You can pullout the source and commit changes; 
or you can build on top of the existing source code and use Java's clean
Object oriented features to overload or override existing classes; we have
document the class source code (you can use the jars while retaining the 
document hierarchy.


========================
 Setup
========================
A. Create your own install package as desired.

 1 just build with netbeans or eclipse IDE
and then run the jar file.  You may need a proper location for the DatabaseConfig.txt

2. Create a database called "questionbox". or anything you want.
3. Run the database script against the above database.
4. Run the jar from this location with the command >java -jar QuestionBox.jar

Note: make sure the lib folder is in the save directory as the jar file you are running.

B. using jars
This is also a sufficient step;
you can use just the lib folder, the QuestionBox.jar, and the DatabaseConfig.txt 
file to create a project structure as shown below;
1. Create a folder
	%mkdir QuestionBox
2. Under the QuestionBox folder copy the following items in that folder
	-QuestionBox.jar
	-lib folder
	-DatabaseConfig.txt
NOTE: Do not forget to run the DatabaseScript.sql against your own MySQL installation; 
For phpMyAdmin users, it is easy; create database (call it questionbox), and import 
the SQL script, click go.

Please refer to your MySQL manual if you want to use the shell/commandline which is 
also easy.

Use MySQL 5.0+

Not tested on MySQL 6.0

Use Java 1.5+ (tested on Java 5 and 6)

Finally:
The project structure
++QuestionBox
--++QuestionBox.jar
--++Lib/
--++DatabaseConfig.txt
